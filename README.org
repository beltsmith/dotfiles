#+TITLE: Doot Doot I'm the dootfiles

* Management
I use [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][stow]] to manage linking my dotfiles. This allows for me to isolate specific configurations by type rather than destination folder.
I also occasionally use it to A/B test configurations by simply unstowing one and stowing the other.

* Emacs
This is 90% of my life now(and currenty using [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs][spacemacs]] as the framework). To use, run the following commands:

#+begin_src shell
  stow emacs
  git clone https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs ~/.emacs.d
#+end_src
